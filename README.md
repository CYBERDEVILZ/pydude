pydude is a complete beginner programmer's game. It takes about 25% of your screen size (size of the game screen: 1000 by 400 ). In this, the character (pydude) runs left, right and even jumps.
The character responds to your key-strokes:

If you press right arrow, he will run right. If you press space bar, pydude will jump

Its just a simple game with no levels as of now (but just the level zero). In the future, as I gain more knowledge in the field of game development, I will add more features to it.

The source code for the game can be downloaded from this github repository. Anyone is free to make changes to it. Obviously bugs will be there but I will try to fix them up as soon as possible.

## How to download

Download this repository and save it in "C:/Program Files". You are good to go.


####Remember! Python must be installed on your desktop####
