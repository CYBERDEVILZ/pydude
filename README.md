pydude is a complete beginner programmer's game. It takes about 25% of your screen size (size of the game screen: 1000 by 400 ). In this, the character (pydude) runs left, right and even jumps.
The character responds to your key-strokes:

If you press right arrow, he will run right. If you press space bar, pydude will jump

Its just a simple game with no levels as of now (but just the level zero). In the future, as I gain more knowledge in the field of game development, I will add more features to it.

The source code for the game can be downloaded from this github repository. Anyone is free to make changes to it. Obviously bugs will be there but I will try to fix them up as soon as possible.

## How to download and configure

Follow these steps carefully to ensure safe installation:

### Pygame must be installed

If you dont have pygame, go to cmd and type in the following command:
*pip install pygame*
then press enter

### Download the game from this repository

The file *pydude-master.zip* will be downloaded. Extract it. hen copy and save the folder called *pydude* in *C:/Program Files*

### Open pydude.py and enjoy

if you have python saved to PATH, you can just double click on the pydude.py to start the game. Else, open cmd in the directory of *pydude* and type in the following command:

*python pydude.py*

{If you have two versions of python installed to path, please mention the version}
